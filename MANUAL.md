## Object of the game

1. Create the 3D terrain game board.
1. Play on the surface where the first player who gets from his/her starting point (a corner of the board) to his/her final destination piece (placed by your opponent) **WINS** the game.
 
## Setup

Place the board on a playing surface and the reamining game components within easy reach of all players.

Players determine their own starting positions at any of the six corners of the board (See marked hex positions below).

![Board layout](/assets/board-layout.svg)

> Take note of the position of the terrain pieces to the notched edge of the board in the figure at the bottom.
> The terrain piece's corner should not be touching the board's corner.
> 
> ![Hex piece orientation](/assets/hex-piece-orientation.svg)

## Creating the terrain

The player with the highest roll starts and play proceeds clockwise.

The **FIRST** hexagon placed by each player **MUST** be in their chosen starting position.

Each player alternately places a terrain piece **NEXT** to pieces already on the board until the board is completely filled.

You should have 5 extra pieces (91 fit on the board).

Players then place their own player token in their starting position and then place the destination token(s) for the **OPPONENT** to their **LEFT** or **RIGHT** (arbitrary).

Destinations must be "reachable" without violating **the elevation rule** (see under **Movement rules** bellow) and only one destination token per terrain piece is allowed.

A destination token may be placed at an unoccupied starting location.

After that, you are ready to play!

## Turn Structure

1. Roll the dice.
2. **MOVE** your player token or **ROTATE** terrain piece, depending on your roll
3. If your roll **DOUBLES** you **MUST ROTATE ANY SINGLE** terrain piece or forfeit the turn.
4. Otherwise, you may spend **MOVEMENT POINTS** to move your player token towards your destination(s)

The number rolled on the **WHITE** die determines the number of **MOVEMENT POINTS**.

The number rolled on the **RED** die determines the **WEATHER**.

 - Even Numbers (2, 4, 6) mean **GOOD WEATHER**.

 - Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5) mean **BAD WEATHER**. 

As you will see later, Bad weather **DOUBLES** the movement points cost of making any move on the board.

## Movement Rules

### Direction

All hex terrain piece has 3 pips (dimples) which indicate the **EXITS OFF** that piece. It's not allowed to move in any direction other that the ones directed by them.

> **_Example:_**
> From terrain piece A you must travel to piece B, then to piece C in order to get to piece D (See RED PIPS).
> From piece D you can get to piece A directly using piece B (SEE BLUE PIPS).
> ![Example for pip directions](/assets/example-direction.png)

As stated before, you are able to **ROTATE** terrain piece if you roll **DOUBLES**, which allows you to change the direction of the pits for any terrain piece you like, changing the paths in the terrain and giving you (and your opponents) access too other parts of the board.

You should also consider **THE ELEVATION RULE** (see bellow), as a some exits off a hex may be blocked by the height of the terrain pieces around it.

### Movement point cost

Players **MAY** spend **ANY** or **NONE** of their movement points to move whatever distance they wish.

The movement points cost of making any move is determine by the below table:

| Movement Type             | Good Weather Points                              | Bad Weather Points                                 | Example                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SAME LEVEL MOVE           | 1 point per Hex                                  | 2 points per Hex                                   | **Move 1 Hex on the same level**<br>![Example for same level move](/assets/example-same.png)<br>Good Weather: 1 MP<br>Bad Weather: 2 MP |
| MOVE DOWN                 | 1 point per level                                | 2 points per level                                 | **Move down 2 levels**<br>![Example for down move](/assets/example-down.png)<br>Good Weather: 2 MP<br>Bad Weather: 4 MP                 |
| MOVE UP                   | 1 point per level<br>AND<br>1 point for going UP | 2 points per level<br>AND<br>2 points for going UP | **Move up 2 levels**<br>![Example for move u!](/assets/example-up.png)<br>Good Weather: 3 MP<br>Bad Weather: 6 MP                       |

As you can see, Bad weather **DOUBLES** the movement points cost **REQUIRED** to make any move on the board.

### The elevation rule

Each terrain pices has an height defined in levels from 1 to 8.

When moving, a player **CANNOT** go **UP** or **DOWN MORE THAN 3 LEVELS** from the terrain piece currenly occupied.

You can use the measuring tool to check the relative "elevation" between to terrain pieces.

> **_Example:_**
> All the GREEN green arrows show legal moves which follow the pit directions without violating **the elevation rule**
> The RED arrrow show an example of an ilegal move that violates the **the elevation rule** even if they would have been theoretically allowed by the pip directions.
> 
> ![Example for elevation rule](/assets/example-elevation.png)


### No players may ocupy the same hex

A player sends another player to the original starting position if the player lands on another player while traveling across the board.

## Optional Rule

Double 6s permit a player to **INVERT** (turn **UPSIDE-DOWN**) **ANY** terrain piece **NOT** occupied by a player or destination marker -- permanently!

The player may chose to do this instead of rotating a terrain piece.

Players can't move to or through **INVERTED** terrain pieces until the end of the game.

All destinations must be "reachable" without violating **THE ELEVATION RULE** once the terrain piece is interted.

If the player choses not to invert a terrain piece or it is not possible to invert any piece, then he/she must rotate a piece instead or forfeit the turn.

> **_Editor's Note:_**
> The intended effect of inverting a terrain piece is not found in any of the recovered materials of the game.
> The above text is only an interpretation that can be guessed from the other game rules and the fact that the base of the terrain pieces have no pips.
> However, feel free to come up with your own interpretation.


## Offense/Defense? HINTS?

- Constructing terrain with many UP-3 LEVEL paths makes traveling more difficult.

- Block paths to destinations by manipulating the pieces so that pips DO NOT point in the proper direction.

- Placing terrain level changes of MORE THAN 3 LEVELS next to pip exits RESTRICTS travel to the remaining pip exits.

## Game Variants

### LOST

**LOST** is a form of the terrain game where ALL players start from the center of the board.
The object of the game is to reach **ANY PERIMETER PIECE** (any terrain piece at the edge of the board).
The first player to do so **WINS**

###  GREEN DIE

In this version, the pips do not control the player's direction of movement. The **GREEN** die does that.

Each corner of the board is designated as a direction numbe, (1-6) Clockwise.

> **_Example:_**
> If the green die was 2, then the movement for that turn would be in a straight line parallel to direction 2.
> 
> ![Example for green die variant](/assets/example-green-die.svg)

The red die (wheather) and white die (movement) are also used.

Now the three dice designate DIRECTION, WHEATHER and MOVEMENT.

Only one player may occupy a terrain piece at a time and players may NOT send a player to their starting.

The elevation rule  also remains in effect.

A player who rolls doubles with the **RED** and **WHITE DICE MUST ROLL THESE DICE AGAIN** using the same direction as previously rolled.

> **__Editor's Note:_**
> The intended effect of this rule is not clear in any of the recovered materials of the game.
> 
> It could be interpreted as:
> - Rolling doubles are rewarded by having the player move again for each roll and reroll, albeit always in the same direction OR ...
> - Double Rolls are ignored and rerolled.
> Feel free to use any of the interpretations above or to come up with an intepretation of your own.

Players MUST move each turn.

> **__Editor's Note:_**
> The intended effect of this rule is not clear in any of the recovered materials of the game.
> 
> There are many intances were a player may be unable to move even a single terrain piece in the direction prescribed by the green dice roll:
> - The edge of the board has been reached.
> - The terrain in that direction may be too steep (see the elevation rule above)
> - The player would land on another player (opponents cant be bumped back to their starting position in this version of the game.
> - The player has not enough movement points to move in the prescribed direction.
> - etc..
>
> Presumably this means that the player would lose their turn.

###  Team Play

First team to get all team mates home **WINS!**

It is required for each teammate to follow the lead player and no teammate may get MORE THAN 3 TERRAIN PIECES AWAT from his/her TEAMMATE.

Teammates may pass one another and take the lead, but must remain within 3 HEXES.

Note: NO Sending back to start.
