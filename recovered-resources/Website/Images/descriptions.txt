gb1.jpg - An elegant wooden board game made of American cherry.
gb9.jpg - The game on a living room table near a window. This picture was taken with a polarization filter to remove any glare from the reflection off the end-grain of the hexagons.
gb6.jpg - The game uses the RED WEATHER DIE and WHITE MOVEMENT DIE and elevation tool to measure one level (1/4"), two level (1/2") and three level (3/4") vertical moves.
gb10.jpg - Another view of the game with playing parts. Notice the elevation tool in the foreground to measure vertical movements of up/down ONE, TWO or THREE LEVELS (each level is 1/4").The GREEN DIE is used in a variation of play called “LOST.” The RED DIE is for WEATHER; the WHITE DIE for MOVEMENT POINTS; and the GREEN DIE is for DIRECTION.

gb7.jpg - An alternate overhead view of the game in sunlight. Here you can notice the valleys and canyons that make up the 3D board and a yellow destination marker in the foreground
gb11.jpg - Kristin places a terrain piece on the board.
gb8.jpg - The terrain pieces consist of eight (8) different heights of hexagons. The smallest hexagon is 1/2" [13 mm] and the largest hexagon is 2 1/4" [57 mm] high. Each elevation differs from the next by 1/4" [6.4 mm]. The calipers represent a precision of no more than +0.005" [+0.1 mm] variation for each hexagon elevation.
