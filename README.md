# The terrain game

This is a recreation/reproduction of the Terrain Game, designed by Gary R. Winfield and published Games with a Twistâ„¢ circa 1997 in Schenectady (NY) USA.

I learned about this game in this reddit thread, but there is a small review in this site and there is an entry for the game in boardgamegeek.com as well.

Since the game (originally made in wood) is out of print and it's almost lost to the ravages time, I decided to use the information and pictures available to make a 3D model of it.

Fortunately, the rules have been preserved in this Wayback Machine page and some pictures, which I have reproduced as PDF attachment.

I have tried to keep faithful to the original size of the game using the data available and some approximation done with the available pictures.

I have also introduced a few improvements:

- The board has slots where you can place the hex pieces.
- The hex pieces hace notches that help identify the difference in level between any two pieces by placing them next to one another. (it is meaningful for the actual game)
- The notches can also be used as a guide to identify where to do color changes.

For the game you will need:

- 1 board
- 96 hex pieces that make up the terrain in the game
- 1 measuring tool
- 6 player tokens (painted or printed in distinct colors)
- 18 destination tokens (using the same colors as the players, three for each)
- 2 dice of different colors (not included in the 3D models)

There are different model alternatives for each for each those components. Just pick the alternatives that suit you and your printer best.

If you chose to use the pieces that have magnet slots, you will need:

- 120 tiny magnets - 2mm dia x 1mm thick (amazon UK link)
- 1 large magnet - 7mm dia x 5 mm thick (amazon UK link)

Just make sure that they are oriented appropriately when you embed them to your print, otherwise you're going to cry.

I have also used Aquarium Fish Tank Sand (ebay UK link) to fill the hex pieces and give them a little weight (just don't add too much or the magnets wont be strong enough (maybe test first)

I can try to add variations of magnets sizes upon request.
I can also try to provide versions of this models at a reduced scale, but that may depend on popular demand.

It took me some time to get my hands on some filament to print this and I ended up uploading this to Tabletop Simulator in Steam.

Great place to test the game before you print it.
