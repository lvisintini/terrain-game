# The terrain game

## Object of the terrain game?

1. Create the 3D terrain game board.
1. Play on the surface where the first player who gets from his/her starting point (a corner of the board) to his/her final destination piece (placed by your opponent) **WINS** the game.

## Who goes first?
 ...the highest roll
 
## Where to Start?

**CLEAR THE BOARD.**

Players determine their own starting positions at any of the six corners of the board (red-shaded hexagons; figure at the right).

The **FIRST** hexagon placed by each player **MUST** be one of the 6 starting positions.

Note the position of the terrain piece to the notched edge of the board in the figure at the bottom. [FIXME]


## Creating terrain?

Each player alternately places a terrain piece **NEXT** to pieces already on the board until the board is completely filled.

You should have 5 extra pieces (91 fit on the board).

Players then place OPPONENT'S destination piece(s).

## Which Way to Go? Pips Tell the Way!

The 3 pips (dimples) are the **EXITS OFF** the terrain piece. 

**_Example:_** From terrain piece A you must travel to piece B, then to piece C in order to get to piece D (See RED PIPS).

**_Note:_** from piece D you can get to piece A directly using piece B (SEE BLUE PIPS).

## Up or Down? THE ELEVATION RULE

You **CANNOT** go **UP** or **DOWN MORE THAN 3 LEVELS**. 

Each level is 1/4 of an inch (6 mm).

Use the elevation TOOL for measuring and rotating pieces.

## For Each Turn ...

Roll the Red Weather Die and the White Movement Die. 

The **RED** die determines the **WEATHER**.

Even Numbers (2, 4, 6) mean Good Weather.

Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5) mean Bad Weather. 

The **WHITE** die determines the number of **MOVEMENT** points.

## Movement Rules

Players **MAY** use **ANY** or **NONE** of their movement points to move whatever distance they wish.
