# The terrain game
- Players: 2-6
- Duration: 60 mins

## Object of the game

1. Create the 3D terrain game board.
1. Play on the surface where the first player who gets from his/her starting point (a corner of the board) to his/her final destination piece (placed by your opponent) **WINS** the game.
 
## Setup

Place the board on a playing surface and the reamining game components within easy reach of all players.

Players determine their own starting positions at any of the six corners of the board (marked hexagons; see picture bellow).

Take note of the position of the terrain pieces to the notched edge of the board in the figure at the bottom. (see picture bellow)

## Creating the terrain

The player with the highest roll starts and play proceeds clockwise.

The **FIRST** hexagon placed by each player **MUST** be in their chosen starting position.

Each player alternately places a terrain piece **NEXT** to pieces already on the board until the board is completely filled.

You should have 5 extra pieces (91 fit on the board).

Players then place their own player token in their starting position and then place the destination token(s) for the **OPPONENT** to their **LEFT** or **RIGHT** (arbitrary).

Destinations must be "reachable" without violating **the elevation rule** (see under **Movement rules** bellow) and only one destination token per terrain piece is allowed.

A destination token may be placed at an unoccupied starting location.

After that, you are ready to play!

## Turn Structure

1. Roll the dice.
2. **MOVE** your player token or **ROTATE** terrain piece, depending on your roll
3. If your roll **DOUBLES** you **MUST ROTATE ANY SINGLE** terrain piece or forfeit the turn.
4. Otherwise, you may spend **MOVEMENT POINTS** to move your player token towards your destination(s)

The number rolled on the **WHITE** die determines the number of **MOVEMENT POINTS**.

The number rolled on the **RED** die determines the **WEATHER**.

 - Even Numbers (2, 4, 6) mean **GOOD WEATHER**.

 - Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5) mean **BAD WEATHER**. 

As you will see later, Bad weather **DOUBLES** the movement points cost of making any move on the board.

## Movement Rules

### Direction

All hex terrain piece has 3 pips (dimples) which indicate the **EXITS OFF** that piece. It's not allowed to move in any direction other that the ones directed by them.

> **_Example:_** From terrain piece A you must travel to piece B, then to piece C in order to get to piece D (See RED PIPS).

> **_Note:_** from piece D you can get to piece A directly using piece B (SEE BLUE PIPS).

As stated before, you are able to **ROTATE** terrain piece if you roll **DOUBLES**, which allows you to change the direction of the pits for any terrain piece you like, changing the paths in the terrain and giving you (and your opponents) access too other parts of the board.

You should also consider **THE ELEVATION RULE** (see bellow), as a some exits off a hex may be blocked by the height of the terrain pieces around it.

### Movement point cost

Players **MAY** spend **ANY** or **NONE** of their movement points to move whatever distance they wish.

The movement points cost of making any move is determine by the below table:

| Movement Type             | Good Weather Points                              | Bad Weather Points                                 | Example                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SAME LEVEL MOVE           | 1 point per Hex                                  | 2 points per Hex                                   | **Move 1 Hex on the same level**<br>![Example for same level move!](/assets/example-same.png)<br>Good Weather: 1 MP<br>Bad Weather: 2 MP |
| MOVE DOWN                 | 1 point per level                                | 2 points per level                                 | **Move down 2 levels**<br>![Example for down move!](/assets/example-down.png)<br>Good Weather: 2 MP<br>Bad Weather: 4 MP                 |
| MOVE UP                   | 1 point per level<br>AND<br>1 point for going UP | 2 points per level<br>AND<br>2 points for going UP | **Move up 2 levels**<br>![Example for move up!](/assets/example-up.png)<br>Good Weather: 3 MP<br>Bad Weather: 6 MP                       |

As you can see, Bad weather **DOUBLES** the movement points cost **REQUIRED** to make any move on the board.

### The elevation rule

Each terrain pices has an height defined in levels from 1 to 8.

When moving, a player **CANNOT** go **UP** or **DOWN MORE THAN 3 LEVELS** from the terrain piece they currenly occupied.

You can use the measuring tool to check the relative "elevation" between to terrain pieces.

### No players may ocupy the same hex

A player sends another player to the original starting position if the player lands on another player while traveling across the board.

## Optional Rule

**AGREE BEFORE PLAYING** with this Optional Rule. 

Double 6s permit a player to **INVERT** (turn **UPSIDE-DOWN**) **ANY** terrain piece **NOT** occupied by a player or destination marker -- permanently!

The player may chose to do this instead of rotating a terrain piece.

Players can't move to or through **INVERTED** terrain pieces until the end of the game.

All destinations must be "reachable" without violating **THE ELEVATION RULE** once the terrain piece is interted.

If the player choses not to invert a terrain piece or it is not possible to invert any piece, then he/she must rotate a piece instead or forfeit the turn.

> **_Note form the editor:_**
> The intended effect of inverting a terrain piece is not found in any of the recovered materials of the game.
> The above text is only an interpretation that can be guessed from the fact that the base of the terrain pieces have no pips and the other game rules.
> However, feel free to come up with your own interpretations.

## Offense/Defense? HINTS?

Constructing terrain with many UP-3 LEVEL paths makes traveling more difficult.

Also block paths to destinations where pips DO NOT point in the proper direction.

Placing terrain level changes of MORE THAN 3 LEVELS next to pip exits RESTRICTS travel to the remaining pip exits.
